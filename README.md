This is my first experiance with github# hello-world
dummy learning about Github by Bill Schlesinger AKA billplaysonline in Ingress.
My goal here is to start learning a little about IITC and how to test the scripts and
help the developers by providing detailes about a failure and even find a way to make it repeatable.
I am NOT a programmer. but I can hack the code to add debug traps and logs to pin down the problem.
Nothing I do will ever be commited to the core project. My stuff is strictly for tracing a problem.
When I find it all my code goes away.
